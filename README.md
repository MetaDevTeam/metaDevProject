# metaDevProject
Our course project that starts as a blog!

## Who we are?

We are a team of 5 enthusiasts, completely divergent in our workcraft, gathered and inspired by our desire to be able to develop and create.

We are Zlatyo, Yulia, Mitko, Pavlin, and Ivanka - each one having his particular and indispensible contribution to our first team website development project.

* __ZLATYO__ created the master branch and implemented the Razor code to integrate the html design into a working website.
* The skin and the html design of the blog is a brainchild of __YUILIA__ who created original styles ignoring the bootsrap ready-to-use templates.
* __MITKO__ had his invaluable contribution to the development of the backend - implemented the image upload and recipes object.
* __PAVLIN__ implemented the Contact form and the functionality of the About section (and controllers controllers for listing only admin profiles), an alternative, moder and complex design that did not get to the repository.
* __IVANKA__ prepared the main documentation related to the blog content, as well as lent a helping hand for the integration of some of the views.

The blog contains Home, About, Recipies, Blog, Contact, Create (Dropdown menu for creating Recipes and Articles) menus.
Home opens the full list of recipes. About says who we are and what it is all about. Recipes contains recipes organized by categories and illustrated by images. The Blog section is intended to enable discussions concerning any recipies or culinary topics initiated by users. The Contact menu allows users to contact us by providing a Contact Form.

Users can register and log in if once registered via the REGISTER and LOGIN functionalities in order to participate in blog discussions. The Search field and the right-standing CATEGORIES and POPULAR TAGS boxes are currently only part of the design (non-functional).
